## Scenario
You are working as a network engineer for an IT company and you have been assigned to design and implement a new enterprise network infrastructure based on traditional technologies and IPv4 addressing for the company.
The company consists of four departments – Finance/HR, Engineering, Sales, and Administration – and provides wired LAN access and PC desktop workstations for office-based users.
The network requires five servers – Web, Email, DNS, Authorisation, and a File/Print server – and access to all servers must be provided for all office-based users. External users can access the company’s external website only.
It is company policy to allow staff to use a wireless network with their own devices, such as smartphones, to access the internet, although these devices should be able to access the servers but not be permitted to access the departmental networks. In addition, the company would like to trial the use of IoT devices to monitor the server room.
The distribution of workstations is shown in Table below, which describes the high-level network requirements for each department.

### Task
